# Bittrex-Binance-Listing-Bot

This project was designed to monitor listing events on the Binance exchange. It is well know, if\when Binance 
anounces that some altcoin will be listed, price of that asset is significantly increases. So tha logic was to 
monitor page where Binance announce coins listing and on the anouncement get the symbol to be listed and try
to buy it on some other exchange, in particular project - Bittrex, as fast as possible - right before price
growth begins. Was partially tested, but can still habe some kind of bugs inside. 

Api keys inside are destroyed, so don't be worry of them.
